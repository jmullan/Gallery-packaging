This is the second installment in the Gallery 2 beta cycle.  In the past 5 weeks we've made <a href="http://tinyurl.com/639hs#whats_new">considerable improvements</a> to the product.  We're one step closer to having a final product.  As with the beta-1 release, we are now providing a well tested upgrade path from here until the final Gallery release.  If you're using Gallery 2 Alpha 4 or more recent, you can upgrade without losing any of your data.

As before, this is a technology release so that we're providing you can get an idea of how the product is maturing.  It is stable and reliable, but does not yet have all the features that you will find in Gallery 1.x.  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4au5f">Download the latest code</a> and play with it!   Before you <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5gnbs">ask for help</a>, please, please <a href="http://tinyurl.com/639hs">read the README</a> -- we've made an effort to answer all of your questions there.  Especially read the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/639hs#known_issues">known issues</a> section.  If you're upgrading, be sure to read the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/639hs#known_issues">instructions</a>.  Then head on over to the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3rgzx">G2 Forums</a> and let us know what you think!

The more feedback you give us now, the better the final version of G2 will be.  Thanks for your continued support!
