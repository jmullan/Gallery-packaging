Gallery 2 Release Candidate 1 (+5 Insightful) Released!

This is the first release candidate of Gallery 2.  We do not anticipate making any substantial changes between now and the final version.  The purpose of this release candidate is to let the product cool for a couple of weeks so that we can identify any fix any last minute issues that you may discover.  So download, install and start test it.

We have made <a href="http://tinyurl.com/8bprb#whats_new">small improvements</a> since the Beta 4 release.  One new thing you'll notice is that now we offer up 4 different flavors of packages for you to download so that you can pick one that suits your needs.  This will make it easier for those of you who are using FTP to transfer Gallery up to your webserver.  You can read all about it on our <a href="http://codex.gallery2.org/index.php/Gallery2:Download">Gallery 2 Download Page</a>.  Note that if you downsize from the more inclusive larger Gallery 2 beta package to one of the smaller RC ones, you should remember to download any extra plugins that you are using.
