Gallery 2 Beta 3 (Bingo!) Released!

This is the third installment in the Gallery 2 beta cycle.  In the past 5 weeks we've made <a href="http://tinyurl.com/b3lod#whats_new">considerable improvements</a> to the product.  We're getting very close to having a final product.  All releases in the beta cycle provide a well tested upgrade path from here until the final Gallery release. If you're using Gallery 2 Alpha 4 or more recent, you can upgrade without losing any of your data. 

As before, this is a technology release so that you can get an idea of how the product is maturing.  It is stable and reliable and though it is missing a few features from Gallery 1.x, it has most of the Gallery 1 functionality and many, many new features that Gallery 1 lacks.  We encourage you to  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4au5f">download the latest code</a> and play with it!   Before you <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5gnbs">ask for help</a>, please, please <a href="http://tinyurl.com/b3lod">read the README</a> -- we've made an effort to answer all of your questions there.  Especially read the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/b3lod#known_issues">known issues</a> section.  If you're upgrading, be sure to scan the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/b3lod#known_issues">instructions</a> first (it's really easy).  Then head on over to the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/3rgzx">G2 Forums</a> and let us know what you think!

The more feedback you give us now, the better the final version of G2 will be.  Thanks for your continued support!
