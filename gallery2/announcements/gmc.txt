This is the first installment in the Gallery 2 beta cycle.  In the past 4 months we've made <a href="http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/*checkout*/gallery/gallery2/README.html?rev=1.70#whats_new">considerable improvements</a> to the product.  This release is a big milestone for many reasons, not the least of which is that we are now providing a well tested upgrade path from here until the final Gallery release.  If you're using Gallery 2 Alpha 4 or more recent, you can upgrade without losing any of your data.

As before, this is a technology release so that we're providing you can get an idea of how the product is maturing.  It is stable and reliable, but does not yet have all the features that you will find in Gallery 1.x.
