Gallery is a slick, intuitive web based photo gallery with
authenticated users and privileged albums. Easy to install, configure
and use. Photo management includes automatic thumbnails, resizing,
rotation, etc. User privileges make this great for communities.

This is the first installment in the Gallery 2 beta cycle.  In the
past 4 months we've made considerable improvements to the product.
This release is a big milestone for many reasons, not the least of
which is that we are now providing a well tested upgrade path from
here until the final Gallery release.  If you're using Gallery 2 Alpha
4 or more recent, you can upgrade without losing any of your data.

As before, this is a technology release so that we're providing you
can get an idea of how the product is maturing.  It is stable and
reliable, but does not yet have all the features that you will find in
Gallery 1.x.  Download the latest code and play with it!  Before you
ask for help, please, please read the README -- we've made an effort
to answer all of your questions there.  Especially read the known
issues section.  If you're upgrading, be sure to read the instructions
(it's really easy).  Then head on over to the G2 Forums and let us
know what you think!

The more feedback you give us now, the better the final version of G2
will be.  Thanks for your continued support!
