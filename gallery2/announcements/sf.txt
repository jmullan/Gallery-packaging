Gallery 2 Beta 4 (Flippin' Sweet!) Released!

Gallery is a slick, intuitive web based photo gallery with authenticated users and privileged albums. Easy to install, configure and use. Photo management includes automatic thumbnails, resizing, rotation, etc. User privileges make this great for communities.

This is the fourth and final installment in the Gallery 2 beta cycle.  In the past two months we've made huge improvements to hte product.  After this, we're going to be making only minor changes as we head into release candidates and then the final release.  As with all releases in the beta cycle, we support upgrading from Gallery 2 Alpha 4 or more recent.

This is a stable and reliable technology release.  It has almost all of the features of Gallery 1, and many many new features that Gallery 1 lacks.  We encourage you to download the latest code and play with it!  Before you ask for help, please, please read the README -- we've made an effort to answer all of your questions there.  Especially read the known issues section.  If you're upgrading, be sure to scan the instructions first (it's really easy).  Then head on over to the G2 Forums and let us know what you think!

The more feedback you give us now, the better the final version of G2 will be.  Thanks for your continued support!
