Gallery 2 Release Candidate 1 (+5 Insightful) Released!

This is the first release candidate of Gallery 2. We do not anticipate
making any substantial changes between now and the final version. The
purpose of this release candidate is to let the product cool for a
couple of weeks so that we can identify any fix any last minute issues
that you may discover. So download, install and start test it.

We have made small improvements since the Beta 4 release. One new
thing you'll notice is that now we offer up 4 different flavors of
packages for you to download so that you can pick one that suits your
needs. This will make it easier for those of you who are using FTP to
transfer Gallery up to your webserver. You can read all about it on
our Gallery 2 Download Page. Note that if you downsize from the more
inclusive larger Gallery 2 beta package to one of the smaller RC ones,
you should remember to download any extra plugins that you are using.

As always before you ask for help, please, please read the README --
we've made an effort to answer all of your questions there. Especially
read the known issues section. If you're upgrading, be sure to scan
the super easy updating instructions first. Then head on over to the
G2 Forums and let us know what you think!

Thanks for your continued support!
