    + update values in changed-plugins.sh and run it
    + for final release (not RC) bump version for new plugins to 1.0.0
  - Bump GalleryVersion and core version in modules/core/module.inc
    + core version: bump 3rd number for RCs, set to 1.x.0 for final
    + update modules/core/CoreModuleExtras::upgrade and ::_prepareConfigUpgrade too
  - perl lib/tools/po/update-all-translations.pl to ensure all language files are up to date
  - Add/update Gallery2:Modules:* and Gallery2:Themes:* codex pages

Release prep for Gallery 2.x.y patch release:
  - Send notice to gallery-redistributors (4-7 days in advance). If possible, give redistributors
    access to release packages in advance.
  - Make fixes/changes, ensure they are merged between trunk and release branch
    (merge changes to -experimental branch too, if necessary)
  - Bump version for every plugin that has changed since last release but hasn't changed version
    + update values in changed-plugins.sh and run it
  - Bump GalleryVersion and core version in modules/core/module.inc in release branch
    + core version: bump 4th number (eg. 1.1.0 -> 1.1.0.1)
    + update modules/core/CoreModuleExtras::upgrade and ::_prepareConfigUpgrade too
  - For 2.x.1 release (first patch for this 2.x), make these changes in *trunk* for both
    upgrade and _prepareConfigUpgrade:
    + Update regexp for "Enable upgrade from any patch release" line.
      Change the [0-N] part so N = x-1 for upcoming G2.x release.
      Example: if next x.y release is 2.3 then regexp should have 1\.[0-2]\.0
    + Add ".x" case to enable upgrades from patch releases (eg. case '1.2.0.x':)


Release steps:
- Update all MANIFEST files
- Make sure all unit tests pass
- Sync a different workspace and verify:
  + upgrading works
  + installer system check doesn't report any missing/modified files (verify on Unix and Windows)
- Tag the release
  + Example for 2.x.0 RC/final release:
    svn mkdir https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/tags/RELEASE_2_2_RC_1
    svn copy https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/trunk/gallery2 https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/tags/RELEASE_2_2_RC_1/gallery2
  + Example for 2.x.y patch release:
    svn copy https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/branches/BRANCH_2_2 https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/tags/RELEASE_2_2_1
- For a 2.x.0 FINAL release, create a release branch:
  + svn copy https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/tags/RELEASE_2_2 https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/branches/BRANCH_2_2
- Update preinstaller/preinstall.php
  + update @versionId to match current version
  + update release numbers in various urls
- Update the TAG and PATCH_FOR vars in build.php
  + PATCH_FOR = array() for 2.x.0 RCs and final, set previous tags for patch release
- build.php scrub
- build.php release
  + It may complain about MANIFEST files needing some FIXME work.  This is from generating
    patch-xxx.txt files.  You can ignore that for now because even though we're building
    those patch files, we're not actually including them in the update zip files.
- build.php preinstaller
- build.php export (or use rsync as mentioned below)
- Update upgrade/patch documentation if necessary (Gallery2:Upgrading_to_2.2.x)
- Prepare release announcement
  + Create story; unpublished, promote to front page, short url = gallery_{version}_released
  + For RC releases, add forum topic for reporting/tracking issues:
    Tech Zone / Gallery 2.x forum, title = Gallery 2.x-RC-y Feedback, unpublished, sticky,
    short url = forum/gallery_2.x_RCy_feedback
  + For final release, make a "press release" version of this announcement
- Create releases and add files using sf.net web interface
  + You can use rsync to upload: `rsync -avP -e ssh * ${USER}@frs.sourceforge.net:uploads/`
  + Create a new release in 'gallery2' package named with just the version number (example: 2.2.1)
    = For Release notes and Change log put this URL with the approprate release tag:
      http://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/*checkout*/gallery/tags/{release tag}/gallery2/README.html#whats_new
    = Add all gallery-* packages, the preinstaller and any update-2.*-to-2.* files to this release
  + For an RC-1 create a new release in 'gallery2 plugins' package,
    named using just the version number, don't add RC-1 (example: 2.2)
    = Leave Release notes and Change log blank
  + Add all g2-* plugin packages to the gallery2 plugins release (note that
    some plugins won't be change so the release system won't let you add
    duplicates. this is fine!)
- Use releaseforge.sf.net for the following:
  + Check "Email Release Notification"
  + Set the file types and architecture (arch = Any, file type = .gz or .zip)
  + Hide older releases (if necessary)
    = for RC-2 or higher, hide previous RC
    = for final release, hide previous RC and N-2 release (ie, G2.2 hides G2.0)
    = for patch release, hide release it patches
- Update Gallery2:Download on the codex
  + Edit RELEASE in update-codex-download-page.php
  + Run update-codex-download-page.php
  + Cut and paste its output on to Gallery2:Download
  + Click "show changes" and verify what you see

    has the current stable release and the RC page can be accessed via oldid query parameter
