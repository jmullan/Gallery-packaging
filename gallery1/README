STEPS TO ROLLING OUT A NEW GALLERY 1.X PACKAGE

1. In your development gallery, edit the Version.php file and set the Gallery
   version appropriately.  It should either be something like:

	1.6.1
	
   or for a release candidate:
	
	1.6.1-RC1
	1.6.1-RC2

2. Update the ChangeLog and put in a divider of some kind (look for 
   others farther down for examples).  

3. Rebuild the file manifest, 
       php tools/build_manifest.php
  [Note can only be run from command line].       

4. Commit these three changed files.


5. svn copy to tag the "gallery", "java", and "docs" modules.
   You have to tag docs and java as well as gallery since the
   image crop java applet and relevant docs are in these packages.
   Use a tag name like this:
	RELEASE_1_4_1
   or:
	RELEASE_1_4_1_RC4

   Create the tag in cvs and copy all files for the release into the tag.
   We used to not tag language files and the tools directory, but the makefile
   takes care of removing all but en_US and the tools directory is now included
   with each release.

ie	svn mkdir https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/tags/RELEASE_1_6_1
	svn copy  https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/trunk/gallery 
		https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/tags/RELEASE_1_6_1/gallery
	svn copy  https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/trunk/docs
		https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/tags/RELEASE_1_6_1/docs
	svn copy https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/trunk/java
		https://gallery.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/tags/RELEASE_1_6_1/java


7. Edit Makefile to point to the BRANCH you have just created.
	
8. type "make clean"
	"make package"

   This will spit out a new tarball in the tardir directory containing
   only the files that should be in the release.  It will be marked
   with the current version from the Version file so it be formatted
   like so:
   
   	gallery-1.3.4-RC1.tar.gz
   	gallery-1.3.4.tar.gz
   
   It shouldn't have a -svn tag, like this:
   
	gallery-1.3.4-svn-b39.tar.gz

9. Type "make export" and the file will get ftp'd to sourceforge.net

10. Go to sf.net and do a file release of the new version.  Take great care the
   first time you do it (it's not totally intuitive) to follow the patterns set
   up by the existing file releases.

   After releasing an official version (not a release candidate, etc) you
   should make sure to hide older releases. 

11. Make announcements. Each of these locations needs a news posting or an update,
   so visit each one and update it following the example of the previous release
   of Gallery 1:

	http://gallery.menalto.com/ -> new front page story
	http://gallery.menalto.com/downloadblock
	http://gallery.menalto.com/downloads
	http://codex.gallery2.org/ -> news block on top right of main page
	http://www.freshmeat.net/the_gallery/
	http://sourceforge.net/news/?group_id=7130
	http://gallery.menalto.com/admin/gmc_versioncheck
	gallery-announce mailing list

12.  Rejoice!

Additional info on branches/tags (was "Gallery Release Tasks" on GMC wiki)

Goal - Release Candidate n
 Action - Create RELEASE_n_n_RCn tag in HEAD
 Action - Continue coding for release candidate in HEAD
 Action - If necessary, create a temporary AFTER_n_n (where n_n is the current
          release number) branch for new non-RC code work
 Repeat as Needed

Goal - Final Release
 Action - Create BRANCH_n_n from HEAD
 Action - Create RELEASE_n_n tag in BRANCH_n_n
 Action - Shove into a corner and begin work on release n+1
 Action - If necessary, merge AFTER_n_n branch into HEAD
