STEPS TO ROLLING OUT A NEW GALLERY 1.X PACKAGE

1. In your development gallery, edit the Version.php file and set the Gallery
   version appropriately.  It should either be something like:

	1.3.4
	
   or for a release candidate:
	
	1.3.4-RC1
	1.3.4-RC2

2. Update the ChangeLog and put in a divider of some kind (look for 
   others farther down for examples).  

3. Rebuild the file manifest, 
       php tools/build_manifest.php
  [Note can only be run from command line].       

4. Commit these three changed files.


5. svn copy to tag the "gallery", "java", and "docs" modules.
   You have to tag docs and java as well as gallery since the
   image crop java applet and relevant docs are in these packages.
   Use a tag name like this:
	RELEASE_1_4_1
   or:
	RELEASE_1_4_1_RC4

   Don't tag any files that should not be in the release.  For 
   instance, nothing in the locale directory except en_US should be 
   included in a standard release.  So untag everything in locale except en_US.
   Similarly, tools should not be tagged.

   Since some files should not be tagged, create the tag as a working copy,
   rather than directly in the repository, remove stuff, then commit:

ie	svn mkdir https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/tags/RELEASE_1_5_3
	svn checkout https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/tags/RELEASE_1_5_3
	svn copy https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/branches/BRANCH_1_5_3/gallery RELEASE_1_5_3
	svn copy https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/branches/BRANCH_1_5_3/docs RELEASE_1_5_3
	svn copy https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/branches/BRANCH_1_5_3/java RELEASE_1_5_3
	svn delete RELEASE_1_5_3/gallery/tools RELEASE_1_5_3/gallery/locale/*
	svn copy https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/gallery/branches/BRANCH_1_5_3/gallery/locale/en_US RELEASE_1_5_3/gallery/locale
	svn commit


7. Edit Makefile to point to the BRANCH you have just created.
	
8. type "make clean"
	"make package"

   This will spit out a new tarball in the tardir directory containing
   only the files that should be in the release.  It will be marked
   with the current version from the Version file so it be formatted
   like so:
   
   	gallery-1.3.4-RC1.tar.gz
   	gallery-1.3.4.tar.gz
   
   It shouldn't have a -svn tag, like this:
   
	gallery-1.3.4-svn-b39.tar.gz

9. Type "make export" and the file will get ftp'd to sourceforge.net

10. Go to sf.net and do a file release of the new version.  Take great care the
   first time you do it (it's not totally intuitive) to follow the patterns set
   up by the existing file releases.

   After releasing an official version (not a release candidate, etc) you
   should make sure to hide releases until only the last two releases are
   visible.  So if you just published 1.3.4, make sure that only 1.3.4 and
   1.3.3 are visible.

11. Make announcements here:
	http://gallery.sourceforge.net->News
	update http://gallery.sourceforge.net->Downloads->Core Gallery
	http://mods.postnuke.com
		(http://mods.postnuke.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=1422)
	http://www.phpnuke.com
		(http://www.phpnuke.org/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=5188)
	http://www.freshmeat.net
	http://www.nukedgallery.net

    Old posts in (parens) are ones you can copy.

12.  Rejoice!

Additional info on branches/tags (was "Gallery Release Tasks" on GMC wiki)

Goal - Release Candidate n
 Action - Create RELEASE_n_n_RCn tag in HEAD
 Action - Continue coding for release candidate in HEAD
 Action - If necessary, create a temporary AFTER_n_n (where n_n is the current
          release number) branch for new non-RC code work
 Repeat as Needed

Goal - Final Release
 Action - Create BRANCH_n_n from HEAD
 Action - Create RELEASE_n_n tag in BRANCH_n_n
 Action - Shove into a corner and begin work on release n+1
 Action - If necessary, merge AFTER_n_n branch into HEAD
